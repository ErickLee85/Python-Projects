#Python_Projects
<br>These are my projects written in Python. They use several modules, such as tkinter, sqlite3, etc.
## Apps:
[File Transfer](https://github.com/ErickLee85/Python-Projects/tree/main/FileTransferGUI)
<br>[DJango Checkbook](https://github.com/ErickLee85/Python-Projects/tree/main/Django_Checkbook)
<br>[Student Tracking](https://github.com/ErickLee85/Python-Projects/tree/main/Student%20Tracking%20Assignment)
<br>[Astronomy Calculator](https://github.com/ErickLee85/Python-Projects/tree/main/OrbitalGUI)
<br>[Gravitational Acceleration](https://github.com/ErickLee85/Python-Projects/tree/main/Gravitational_Acceleration)
<br>[Store Hours](https://github.com/ErickLee85/Python-Projects/blob/main/StoreHoursGUI.py)

### File Transfer 
This app utilizes a gui that will browse a folder of your choice and iterate through each file, checking if it was modified within a specified time and if True, will move those files to designated folder.
### Django Checkbook
Utilized both DJango and Python in a virtual environment with PyCharm to create an interactive webpage that acts as a bank with Accounts/Transactions/Balances.
### Student Tracking
Built a GUI with tkinter that tracks all Student information (First name, last name, class, etc.) with a sqlite3 database.
### Astronomy Calculator
This app calculates any objects orbital period based off one argument: its the distance from the sun. I created this during my leisure time because I love Astronomy :) and it helped me to become better because it required tkinter Canvas with which I had no previous experience with.
### Gravitational Acceleration
This one was fun, it will tell you how far you travel based off the time entered and the graviational body of your choosing! Have fun :)
### Store Hours
This app checks to see if various branches around the world of a store are open or not. You can simply select your branch from a list and it will provide you with the answer you seek.
